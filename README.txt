An example of how to run my code can be found in main.py. Basically, read in an image file, convert it to a numpy array, then call carv.py on the image, specifying the number of rows and columns that should be removed from the image.

For this assignment, I collaborated with Marissa Como (whiteboard sessions). The code is, of course, my own.
